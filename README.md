# WolfChart v1.1
by Ballantyne de Wolf and Offspring Digital

This is professional optometrist/optician/ophthalmologist tool for measuring visual acuity. I cannot be used safely by the general public.
If you have any concerns about your vision or eyes, consult a qualified professional.

Now that's out of the way, the objectives are:
  1. Clinically relevant, scientifically supported visual acuity measurement in the widest possible range of clinical settings
  2. Open source with GNU licence
  3. Can be used on a wide variety of screen hardware
  3. Customisable optotypes and alphabets. I anticipate the average eyecare professional cannot achieve this, but with instructions
     a high street level web designer can achieve it. The task is to write valid svg and xml and change one line in the index.htm
    
    
Ver1.1
Supports 4 optotypes with an alphabet each. Help text needs some work.
