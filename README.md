This is professional optometrist/optician/ophthalmologist tool for measuring visual acuity. I cannot be used safely by the general public.
If you have any concerns about your vision or eyes, consult a qualified professional.

Now that's out of the way, the objectives are:
  1. Clinically relevant, scientifically supported visual acuity measurement in the widest possible range of clinical settings
  2. Open source with GNU licence
  3. Can be used on a wide variety of screen hardware
  3. Customisable optotypes and alphabets. I anticipate the average eyecare professional cannot achieve this, but with instructions
     a high street level web designer can achieve it. The task is to write valid svg and xml and change one line in the index.htm
    
    
Ver1.3
Added duochrome function with a shortcut key to be assigned in config form.
Help and very quick guide updated

Ver1.2
Help text updated

Expanded Sloan and Snellen optotypes.

New alphabets for 
  - BS4724.3
  - SnellenU
  - ETDRS
  - SloanU

Improved letter R in both Sloan and Snellen
  - ISSUE need to apply opacity to svg, not elements of svg, so that characters can have overlapping elements

Added text under HELP in guide-section:  "Very quick guide: Calibrate and configure your chart using this help guide. Click or tap on white space to scroll the chart up and down, or use the up and down arrows on your keyboard. Click or tap on any letter to mask it. Click it again to unmask."

Ver1.1
Supports 4 optotypes with an alphabet each. Help text needs some work.
